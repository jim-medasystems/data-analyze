# Data Analysis tool

This is a very generic data analysis tool for the latest hackathon (Jan 26, 2024)

## How to run

This is a dev only environment for demo purposes.

To run the backend (FastAPI):
'''
cd backend
pipenv install
pipenv run uvicorn app:app --reload
'''

To run the frontend (React+TypeScript+Vite):
'''
cd frontend
npm run dev
'''

You should now be able to access the demo via: http://localhost:5173
